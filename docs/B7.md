### B.7 Compile-time IO

These functions control file IO during elaboration. The functions are expressed as modules and can
only be used as statements inside amodule...endmoduleblock.

The typeHandleis a primitive type for a file handle. The value is returned when you open a file
and is used to specify the file by the other functions.

The flag-fdir, described in theUser Guide, can be used to specify where relative file paths should
be based from.

The typeIOModeis an enumerated type with three values:ReadMode,WriteMode, andAppendMode:


Bluespec SystemVerilog Reference Guide

```
typedef enum { ReadMode, WriteMode, AppendMode } IOMode;
```
When opening a file you specify the mode (IOMode) and the filename. Opening a file in write mode
creates a new file; in append mode it adds to an existing file.

```
openFile Opens a file and returns the typeHandle.
```
```
module openFile #(String filename, IOMode mode) (Handle);
```
The functionhCloseexplicitly closes the file with the specified handle. The compiler will close any
handles that are still open at the end of elaboration, or upon exiting with an error, but you shouldnâ€™t
rely on this. Buffered files will be flushed when the file is closed.

```
hClose Closes the file with the specified handle.
```
```
module hClose #(Handle hdl) ();
```
The following functions provide query functions for handles.

```
hIsEOF Returns a Bool indicating if the end of file has been reached for the
specified handle.
```
```
function Bool hIsEOF (Handle hdl);
```
```
hIsOpen Returns true if the the handlehdlis open.
function Bool hIsOpen (Handle hdl);
```
```
hIsClosed Returns true if the handlehdlis closed.
```
```
function Bool hIsClosed (Handle hdl);
```
```
hIsReadable Returns true if the handle has been opened in Readable mode and can
be read from.
```
```
function Bool hIsReadable (Handle hdl);
```
```
hIsWriteable Returns true if handle has been opened in Writeable mode and can be
written to.
```
```
function Bool hIsWriteable (Handle hdl);
```

The default buffering of files is determined by your system. If the system is buffering, you may not
see any output until the handle is flushed or closed. You can override this by setting the buffering
policy of the handle, so that writes are not buffered, or are line buffered. The file handle functions
hFlush,hGetBuffering, andhSetBufferingallow you to control buffering.

At the end of elaboration, or upon exiting with an error, the compiler closes any file handles that
were not otherwised closed. Any buffered files will be flushed at this point.

The data typeBufferModeindicates the type of buffering.

```
typedef union tagged {
void NoBuffering;
void LineBuffering;
Maybe#(Integer) BlockBuffering;
} BufferMode;
```
```
hFlush Explicitly flushes the buffer with the specified handle.
```
```
function Action hFlush(Handle hdl);
```
```
hGetBuffering Returns the buffering policy of the file with the specified handle.
```
```
function ActionValue#(BufferMode) hGetBuffering(Handle hdl);
```
```
hSetBuffering Sets the buffering mode for the file with the specified handle if the file
system supports it.
```
```
function Action hSetBuffering(Handle hdl, BufferMode mode);
```
The functionshPutStrandhPutStrLnwrite strings to a file. The functionhPutStrLnadds a newline
to the end of the string.

```
hPutStr Writes the string to the file with the specified handle.
```
```
module hPutStr #(Handle hdl, String str) ();
```
```
hPutStrLn Writes the string to the file with the specified handle and appends a
newline to the end of the string.
```
```
module hPutStr #(Handle hdl, String str) ();
```
```
hPutChar Writes the character to the file with the specified handle.
```
```
module hPutChar #(Handle hdl, Char c) ();
```

Bluespec SystemVerilog Reference Guide

```
hGetChar Reads the character from the file with the specified handle.
```
```
module hGetChar #(Handle hdl) (Char);
```
```
hGetLine Reads a line from the file with the specified handle.
```
```
module hGetLine #(Handle hdl) (String);
```
```
Example: Creates a file namedsysBasicWrite.logcontaining the line"Hello World".
```
```
String fname = "sysBasicWrite.log";
```
```
module sysBasicWrite ();
Handle hdl <- openFile(fname, WriteMode);
hPutStr(hdl, "Hello");
hClose(hdl);
mkSub;
endmodule
```
```
module mkSub ();
Handle hdl <- openFile(fname, AppendMode);
hPutStrLn(hdl, " World");
hClose(hdl);
endmodule
```
