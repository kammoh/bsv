## B.2 Data Types

Every variable and every expression in BSV has atype. Prelude defines the data types which are
always available. Aninstancedeclaration defines a data type as belonging to a type class. Each
data type may belong to one or more type classes; all functions, modules, and operators declared
for the type class are then defined for the data type. A data type does not have to belong to any
type classes.

Data type identifiers must always begin with a capital letter. There are three exceptions;bit,int,
andreal, which are predefined for backwards compatibility.

### B.2.1 Bit

To define a value of type Bit:

```
```

```
```
Bool b1 = True;
Bool b2 = True;
Bool b3 = b1 && b2;

### B.2.6 Real

TheRealtype is a data type used for real values and functions.

Real numbers are of the form:

```
Real ::= decNum[.decDigitsUnderscore]exp[sign]decDigitsUnderscore
| decNum.decDigitsUnderscore
sign ::=+|-
exp ::=e|E
decNum ::=decDigits[decDigitsUnderscore]
decDigits ::={ 0 ... 9 }
decDigitsUnderscore ::={ 0 ... 9 ,_}
```
If there is a decimal point, there must be digits following the decimal point. An exponent can start
with either anEor ane, followed by an optional sign (+or-), followed by digits. There cannot be an
exponent or a sign without any digits. Any of the numeric components may include an underscore,
but an underscore cannot be the first digit of the real number.


Bluespec SystemVerilog Reference Guide

Unlike integer numbers, real numbers are of limited precision. They are represented as IEEE floating
point numbers of 64 bit length, as defined by the IEEE standard.

Because the typeRealis not part of theBitstypeclass, theRealtype is used for static elaboration
only; all values must be resolved at compile time.

There are many functions defined forRealtypes, provided in theRealpackage (Section C.5.1). To
use these functions, theRealpackage must be imported.

$realtobits Converts from aRealto the IEEE 64-bit vector representation.
```
```
function Bit#(64) $realtobits (Real x) ;

Bit#(11) exp1 = 1024;
Real r1 = $bitstoreal({sign1, exp1, mantissa1}); //r1 = 2.0
```
```
Real x = pi;
let m = realToString(x)); // m = 3.141592653589793
```
### B.2.7 String

Strings are mostly used in system tasks (such as$display). TheStringtype belongs to theEqtype
class; strings can be tested for equality and inequality using the==and!=operators. TheString
type is also part of theArithclass, but only the addition (+) operator is defined. All otherArith
operators will produce an error message.

tpl_4 (x) Extracts the fourth field of x from a Tuple4 to Tuple8.
tpl_5 (x) Extracts the fifth field of x from a Tuple5 to Tuple8.
tpl_6 (x) Extracts the sixth field of x from a Tuple6, Tuple7 or Tuple8.
tpl_7 (x) Extracts the seventh field of x from a Tuple7 or Tuple8.
tpl_8 (x) Extracts the seventh field of x from a Tuple8.

### B.2.13 Array

Array variables are generally declared anonymously, using the bracket syntax described in section

For example, the following declarations using bracket syntax:

```

```
```

```

Reference Guide Bluespec SystemVerilog

are equivalent to the following declarations using the explicit type constructor:

```
Array#(Bool) arr;
```
```
function Bool fn(Array#(Bool) bits);
```
Note that, unlikeVector, the size of an array is not part of its type. In the first declaration, a size is
given for the arrayarr. However, sincearris not assigned to a value, the size is unused here. If the
array were assigned, the size would be used like a type declaration, to check that the assigned value
has the declared size. Since it is not part of the type, this check would occur during elaboration,
and not during type checking.

### B.2.14 Ordering

TheOrderingtype is used as the return type for the result of generic comparators, including the
comparefunction defined in theOrd(Section B.1.7) type class. The valid values ofOrderingare:

### B.2.18 Inout

AnInouttype is a first class type that is used to pass Verilog inouts through a BSV module. It
takes an argument which is the type of the underlying signal:

```

For example, the type of anInoutsignal which communicates boolean values would be:

```
Inout#(Bool)
```
```
Type Classes forInout

Inout
```
AnInouttype is a valid subinterface type (likeClockandReset). A value of anInouttype is
clocked_byandreset_bya particular clock and reset.

Inouts are connectable via theConnectabletypeclass. The use ofmkConnectioninstantiates a
Verilog moduleInoutConnect. The connected inouts must be on the same clock and the same reset.
The clock and reset of the inouts may be different than the clock and reset of the parent module of
themkConnection.

```
instance Connectable#(Inout#(a, x1), Inout#(a, x2))
provisos (Bit#(a,sa));
```
A module with anInoutsubinterface cannot leave that interface undefined since there is no way to
create or examine inout values in BSV. For example, you cannot even write:

```
Inout#(int) i =? ; // not valid in BSV
```
TheInouttype exists only so that RTL inout signals can be connected in BSV; the ultimate users
of the signal will be outside the BSV code. An imported Verilog module might have an inout port
that your BSV design doesn’t use, but which needs to be exposed at the top level. In this case, the
submodule will introduce an inout signal that the BSV cannot read or write, but merely provides
in its interfaces until it is exposed at the top level. Or, a design may contain two imported Verilog
modules that have inout ports that expect to be connected. You can import these two modules,
declaring that they each have a port of typeInout#(t)and connect them together. The compiler
will check that both ports are of the same typetand that they are in the same clock domain with
the same reset. Beyond that, BSV does not concern itself with the values of the inout signals.

Examples

Instantiating a submodule with an inout and exposing it at the next level:

```
interface SubIfc;
...
interface Inout#(Bool) b;
endinterface
```
```
interface TopIfc;
...
interface Inout#(Bool) bus;
endinterface
```
```
module mkTop (TopIfc);
SubIfc sub <- mkSub;
...
interface bus = sub.b;
endmodule
```
Connecting two submodules, usingSubIfcdefined above:

```
module mkTop(...);
```
```
SubIfc sub1 <- mkSub;
SubIfc sub2 <- mkSub;
mkConnection (sub1.b, sub2.b);
```

endmodule

### B.2.19 Action/ActionValue

Any expression that is intended to act on the state of the circuit (at circuit execution time) is called
anactionand has typeActionorActionValue#(a). The type parameterarepresents the type of
the returned value.

```

Action
```
The typesActionandActionValueare special keywords, and therefore cannot be redefined.

```
typedef···abstract···struct ActionValue#(type a);
```
```
ActionValuetype aliases
Action The Action type is a special case of the more general type
ActionValuewhere nothing is returned. That is, the returns type
is(void).
typedef ActionValue#(void) Action;
```
```
ActionFunctions
noAction An emptyAction, this is anActionthat does nothing.
```
```
function Action noAction();
```
Examples

```
method Action grab(Bit#(8) value);
last_value <= value;
endmethod
```
```
interface IntStack;
method Action push (int x);
method ActionValue#(int) pop();
endinterface: IntStack
```
```
seq
noAction;
endseq

### B.2.20 Rules

A rule expression has typeRulesand consists of a collection of individual rule constructs. Rules
are first class objects, hence variables of typeRulesmay be created and manipulated.Rulesvalues
must eventually be added to a module in order to appear in synthesized hardware.

```

Rules
```
TheRulesdata type provides functions to create, manipulate, and combine values of the typeRules.

```
RulesFunctions
emptyRules An empty rules variable.
function Rules emptyRules();
```
```
addRules Takes rulesrand adds them into a module. This function may only
be called from within a module. The return typeEmptyindicates
that the instantiation does not return anything.
```
```
module addRules#(Rules r) (Empty);
```
```
rJoin Symmetric union of two sets of rules. A symmetric union means
that neither set is implied to have any relation to the other: not
more urgent, not execute before, etc.
```
```
function Rules rJoin(Rules x, Rules y);
```
```
rJoinPreempts Union of two sets of rules, with rules on the left getting scheduling
precedence and blocking the rules on the right.That is, if a rule in
setxfires, then all rules in setyare prevented from firing. This is
the same as specifyingdescending_urgencyplus a forced conflict.
function Rules rJoinPreempts(Rules x, Rules y);
```
```
rJoinDescendingUrgency
Union of two sets of rule, with rules in the left having higher urgency.That
is, if some rules compete for resources, then scheduling will select rules in
setxset before sety. If the rules do not conflict, no conflict is added; the
rules can fire together.
```
```
function Rules rJoinDescendingUrgency(Rules x, Rules y);
```

Bluespec SystemVerilog Reference Guide

```
rJoinMutuallyExclusive
Union of two sets of rule, with rules in the all rules in the left set anno-
tated as mutually exclusive with all rules in the right set.No relationship
between the rules in the left set or between the rules in the right set
is assumed. This annotation is used in scheduling and checked during
simulation.
```
```
function Rules rJoinMutuallyExclusive(Rules x, Rules y);
```
```
rJoinExecutionOrder
Union of two sets of rule, with the rules in the left set executing before the
rules in the right set.No relationship between the rules in the left set or
between the rules in the right set is assumed. If any pair of rules cannot
execute in the specified order in the same clock cycle, that pair of rules
will conflict.
```
```
function Rules rJoinExecutionOrder(Rules x, Rules y);
```
```
rJoinConflictFree
Union of two sets of rule, with the rules in the left set annotated as
conflict-free with the rules in the right set. This assumption is used during
scheduling and checked during simulation. No relationship between the
rules in the left set or between the rules in the right set is assumed.
```
```
function Rules rJoinConflictFree(Rules x, Rules y);
```
Examples(See Section 9.13 for complete example)

```
function Rules incReg(Reg#(CounterType) a);
return( rules
rule addOne;
a <= a + 1;
endrule
endrules);
endfunction
```
```
// Add incReg rule to increment the counter
addRules(incReg(asReg(counter)));
```
